	abstract = {We formulate a geometric measurement theory of dynamical classical systems possessing both continuous and discrete degrees of freedom. The approach is covariant with respect to choices of clocks and naturally incorporates laboratories. The latter are embedded symplectic submanifolds of an odd-dimensional symplectic structure. When suitably defined, symplectic geometry in odd dimensions is exactly the structure needed for covariance. A fundamentally probabilistic viewpoint allows classical supergeometries to describe discrete dynamics. We solve the problem of how to construct probabilistic measures on supermanifolds given a (possibly odd dimensional) supersymplectic structure. This relies on a superanalog of the Hodge star for differential forms and a description of probabilities by convex cones. We also show how stochastic processes such as Markov chains can be described by supergeometry.},

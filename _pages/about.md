I am a 5th year physics PhD candidate at <a href='https://physics.ucdavis.edu/'>UC Davis</a>. I am working with Prof. <a href='https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/people/general-profile?fac_id=wally'>Andrew Waldron</a> in the <a href='https://qmap.ucdavis.edu'>QMAP</a> group. My research is in quantization of manifolds with a focus on associated geometric structures.

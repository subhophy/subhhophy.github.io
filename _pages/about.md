I am a 5th year physics PhD candidate at <a href='https://physics.ucdavis.edu/'>UC Davis</a>. I am working with Prof. <a href='https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/people/general-profile?fac_id=wally'>Andrew Waldron</a> in the <a href='https://qmap.ucdavis.edu'>QMAP</a> group. My research is in quantization of manifolds with a focus on associated geometric structures. 

I am particularly interested in odd dimensional manifolds that model phasespacetime. Quantization is the data of a flat connection on a Hilbert bundle over the manifold.  Quantum dynamics or Schrodinger equation is a parallel transport problem for vectors in the Hilbert space with respect to the flat connection. See <a href='https://projecteuclid.org/journals/journal-of-differential-geometry/volume-40/issue-2/A-simple-geometrical-construction-of-deformation-quantization/10.4310/jdg/1214455536.full'>here</a> and <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04557'>here</a> for more on this beautiful geometric picture!
